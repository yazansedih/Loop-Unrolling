<h1>Loop-Unrolling</h1>
Loop unrolling is an optimization technique used to increase the performance of loops in programming by reducing the overhead of loop control instructions. It involves replicating the loop body multiple times within a single iteration, thereby decreasing the number of iterations and improving the execution speed by allowing more efficient use of the CPU pipeline.
